Project Title: Dual-Axis Chart Analysis for Free vs. Paid Apps in Top App Categories on Google Play Store

Project Overview: This project focuses on creating a dual-axis chart to compare the average installs and revenue for free vs. paid apps within the top 3 app categories. The analysis includes several important filters to refine the dataset and ensure only relevant apps are considered:

Key Filters Applied:

    Installations: Exclude apps with fewer than 10,000 installs.
    Revenue: Only include apps with revenue greater than $10,000.
    Android Version: Consider only apps with an Android version higher than 4.0.
    App Size: Filter apps with a size greater than 15MB.
    Content Rating: Only include apps rated as "Everyone".
    App Name: Ensure that app names have no more than 30 characters (including spaces and special characters).

Deliverables:

    A dual-axis chart that visualizes:
        Average Installs (on one axis)
        Average Revenue (on the other axis)
    Comparative analysis between Free and Paid apps within the top 3 app categories.

This project provides insights into how free and paid apps perform in terms of installs and revenue across major app categories while maintaining strict data filtering criteria.
